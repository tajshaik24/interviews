LeetCode 759. Employee Free Time

We are given a list schedule of employees, which represents the working time for each employee.

Each employee has a list of non-overlapping Intervals, and these intervals are in sorted order.

Return the list of finite intervals representing common, positive-length free time for all employees, also in sorted order.

Note:
schedule and schedule[i] are lists with lengths in range [1, 50].
0 <= schedule[i].start < schedule[i].end <= 10^8.
